This repository contains laboratory course scripts for advanced ITC experiments:

1a) Titrations of different ligands (benzamidin, leupeptin) with trypsin (english version)
1b) Same as 1a, but in German.
2) Low budget variant using titrations of EDTA with different divalent ions.

For convinient result evaluation, habe a look at our ITC calculator tool: https://itccalc.uni-mainz.de/

More details about the theoretical background and further experiments will follow soon.
